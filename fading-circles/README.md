# Fading Circles

First experiment with code-based art in R.  
Here I'm taking inspiration from the beautiful work of [@alcrego](https://linktr.ee/alcrego), especially their [• Throbs • 1/4](https://twitter.com/alcrego_/status/1662676901222047748?s=46).

![A figure depicting arching white lines of different length, on a black background. Lines form a semi-circle in the top half of the figure and one in the bottom half, with the color of the lines fading from left to right and from right to left, respectively. A bright dot is present on top of each line, around three quarters of the length. ](https://github.com/Fra-Grassi/R-art/blob/main/fading-circles/fading_circles.png?raw=true)
