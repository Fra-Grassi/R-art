# Collatz Lines

An attempt to draw lines in a generative manner, by using the set of rules of the Collatz Conjecture.  
The idea comes from the reading of the [aRtsy project](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aRtsy/readme/README.html).  
While I still didn't try to use the aRtsy package, their example of drawing lines following the Collatz Conjecture inspired this small project of mine.
