# R-art

Some experiments with generative/code-base art in R.

- **fading-circles**: taking inspiration from the beautiful work of [@alcrego](https://linktr.ee/alcrego).
- **collatz-lines**: generating lines by using according to the rules of the Collatz Conjecture.
- **vect-neighborhoods**: turning cellular automata to art, following the design by [Antonio Sánchez Chinchón's](https://fronkonstin.com/2021/01/02/neighborhoods-experimenting-with-cyclic-cellular-automata/)
